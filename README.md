# [Murmelpass (Chrome) Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/murmelpass/mapffpggohioipkafngincgbnleljnfh)

A password manager extension that doesn't store any passwords.

A safe way to access unique passwords, without actually storing them anywhere, and accessing them with one master password that together with your username and the current URL procedurally generates the correct password for you. No verification, no decryption, nothing to crack.
